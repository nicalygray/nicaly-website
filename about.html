				<p>Over the years I have gone down many different directions and tried other paths but I always find myself being drawn back to design and web development.  Even in pursuing my first degree of French and European Studies, one of the main things that drew me in was the culture and style associated with francophiles.  When I finally accepted this is what I want to do, there was a weight of uncertainty lifted of my shoulders. I now find I am happy with the direction I am going.  Design and development to me isn’t just about drawing something pretty, it is a something more complete, overarching and lasting.  “Pretty” can be temporary but I crave timeless appeal and function. </p>

				<p>Growing up I found I was always interested in art, design, shape and function but I didn’t take classes or know how to explore this interest.  In my teens I taught myself web design and build my own personal websites throughout high school.  I would be up until 4am on nights when I was motivated and trying to get a new site layout finished to publish to the server.  It was an extra-curricular passion that I am now excited to turn into a career.  A career I can be excited to develop and grow.  It is always changing and presenting new challenges and problems to solve.  That is the nature of the field.  There is no problem too difficult to solve.  </p>

				<p>I look forward to solving all the problems thrown my way and helping others solve theirs in the process.  Whether it be web development, design or anything within that spectrum.  </p>
